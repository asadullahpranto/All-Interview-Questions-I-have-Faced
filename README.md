# All Interview Questions I have Faced

## 1. Tell me about yourself/ give some introduction about you.
## 2. There is a popular method for swaping two values in swift, can demonstrate this?
   Ohh, yes. By using **Tuple** data type we can swap values easily. **Tuple** is a native data type for Swift.
   For example, if we have two values like 
   ```swift
    require 'redcarpet'
    markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
    puts markdown.to_html
  ```
